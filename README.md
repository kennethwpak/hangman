# hangman
Group members: Kenneth Pak, Jingran Cao, Lei Xu

This is our hangman project, which will emulate the classic hangman game with a human player guessing a word that the computer has randomly chosen.

Data- 

How to run it:
  import hangman1
  
  hangman1.hangman(hangman1.secret_word)

There should be a space for you to input after you run the above code. 
When you input "cheat", the word appear. You are expected to see "You cheat but you win this game." 
When you input "show", it shows all the same letters in the secret word each time and the available times and letters left and you continue guessing until you win or lose.
When you input "dele", it deletes a letter that doesn't belong to the secret word as a hint and you continue guessing until you win or lose.
